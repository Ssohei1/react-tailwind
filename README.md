# **Restaurant Template Website**

This is a **React.js** project built as a template for showcasing restaurant websites. The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, ensuring a modern and responsive design. It serves as a sample project, demonstrating a clean and professional layout for potential restaurant clients.

In this build, I focused on adding a little extra JavaScript with the `array.filter` method to filter out specific food types and pricing categories.

## **Features**
- **React.js**: Component-based architecture for dynamic and reusable UI.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Simplifies styling with utility-first CSS classes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Modern Layout**: Clean and attractive design tailored for restaurants.
- **Reusable Template**: Can be adapted to fit various restaurant styles.

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ssohei1/react-tailwind.git
   ```
